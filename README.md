# Computer_Vision_Color_Spaces
In this assignment we will learn the basics of color spaces and manipulation
of image colors. Although MATLAB has many built in functions, our goal is
to learn image processing through doing things ourselves.
The assignment requirements are described in the pdf file named Ex2_Color_Spaces.
The MATLAB code file is named Ex2.m.
The final assignment report is described in the pdf file named NA-311394357_CM-208491787.
